These topics describe how <%= vars.product_name_full %> (<%= vars.product_name %>) operators can monitor their <%= vars.product_runtime %> (<%= vars.product_short %>) deployments. For information about monitoring <%= vars.pks_product_full %> (<%= vars.pks_product_short %>) deployments, see [Logging and Monitoring <%= vars.pks_product_short %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/monitor.html).

For more information about logging and metrics in <%= vars.product_name %>, see [Overview of Logging and Metrics](../loggregator/data-sources.html).


## <a id="guide"></a> Overview

This guide includes the following topics:

* [Key Performance Indicators](kpi.html): A list of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that operators may want to monitor with their <%= vars.product_short %> deployment to help ensure it is in a good operational state.

* [Key Capacity Scaling Indicators](key-cap-scaling.html): A list of capacity scaling indicators that operators may want to  monitor to determine when they need to scale their <%= vars.product_short %> deployments.

* [Selecting and Configuring a Monitoring System](metrics.html): Guidance for setting up <%= vars.product_short %> with monitoring platforms to continuously monitor component metrics and trigger health alerts.


## <a id="new"></a> KPI and Scaling Changes from <%= vars.product_short %> v2.6 to <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

This table highlights new and changed KPIs and scaling indicators in <%= vars.product_short %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

        These <code>gorouter.registry_message.route-emitter</code> and <code>route_emitter.HTTPRouteNATSMessagesEmitted</code>metrics are no longer an accurate representation of routing health. In <%= vars.product_short %> v2.4 and later, Gorouter skips the TTL for routes that are registered with TLS. This means the routes never expire or get pruned, other than in an attempt to connect to an invalid back end.

    <td width='50%'>
      Within <%= vars.product_short %>, logs and metrics enter Loggregator for transport and then egress through Doppler. Doppler drops messages when consumers of the RLP, such as monitoring tool nozzles, ingest the exiting stream of logs and metrics too slowly.
      <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>doppler.dropped</code> metric includes both <code>ingress</code> and <code>egress</code> directions, but <code>egress</code> is a newly added distinction. To differentiate between <code>ingress</code> and <code>egress</code>, see the <code>direction</code> tag on the metric.</p>
