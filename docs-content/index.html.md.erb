This guide describes how Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) operators can monitor their Pivotal Application Service (PAS) deployments. For information about monitoring Pivotal Container Service (PKS) deployments, see [Logging and Monitoring PKS](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/monitor.html).

For more information about logging and metrics in PCF, see [Overview of Logging and Metrics](../loggregator/data-sources.html).


## <a id="guide"></a> Overview

This guide includes the following topics: 

* <a class="subnav" href="./kpi.html">Key Performance Indicators</a>: A list of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that operators may want to monitor with their PAS deployment to help ensure it is in a good operational state.
* <a class="subnav" href="./key-cap-scaling.html">Key Capacity Scaling Indicators</a>: A list of capacity scaling indicators that operators may want to  monitor to determine when they need to scale their PAS deployments.
* <a class="subnav" href="./metrics.html">Selecting and Configuring a Monitoring System</a>: Guidance for setting up PAS with monitoring platforms to continuously monitor component metrics and trigger health alerts.


## <a id="new"></a> KPI and Scaling Changes from PAS v2.5 to v2.6

This table highlights new and changed KPIs and scaling indicators in PAS v2.6.

  <tr>
    <td width='10%'>Removed</td>
    <td width='20%'>Number of Route Registration Messages Sent and Received
    <td width='50%'>
        In PAS 2.4 and above, GoRouter will skip the TTL for routes that are registered with TLS. So the routes will never expire or be pruned (other than in an attempt to connect to an invalid backend), which means these metrics are no longer an accurate representation of routing health.
        Affected metrics: <code>gorouter.registry_message.route-emitter</code> & <code>route_emitter.HTTPRouteNATSMessagesEmitted</code>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width='10%'>Modified</td>
    <td width='20%'>Doppler Egress Dropped Messages
    <td width='50%'>
      Within PAS, logs and metrics enter Loggregator for transport and then egress through Doppler. Doppler drops messages when consumers of the RLP, such as monitoring tool nozzles, ingest the exiting stream of logs and metrics too slowly.
      <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>doppler.dropped</code> metric includes both <code>ingress</code> and <code>egress</code> directions, but <code>egress</code> is a newly added distinction. To differentiate between <code>ingress</code> and <code>egress</code>, see the <code>direction</code> tag on the metric.</p>
